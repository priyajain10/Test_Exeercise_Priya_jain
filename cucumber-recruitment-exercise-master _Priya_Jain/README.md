# Technical test

Task: Implement the step definitions `src/test/java/com/bnkbl/stepdefs/UsersStepDefs.java`, 
to test an implementation of the `UserRepository` interface. 

Do NOT modify any code under `src/main`

The system under test is a simple class with two methods. Using the BDD approach we need to test the
creation of users and then the retrieval of the users.

Details of the class (SUT) can be found at line 14 in the `UsersStepDef.java` file

Starting skeleton code is provided in `src/test/java/com/bnkbl/stepdefs/UsersStepDefs.java` and has been generated by cucumber
